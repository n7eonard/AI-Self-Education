# AI-Self-Education
Welcome to my AI self education repo. This is my personal space for hands-on learning and experimentation with various AI related topics. It contains my notes, folders with small projects.

## Session Summaries

### How to Add Sessions

- Source of truth: add each new session directly to `README.md` under `## Session Summaries`.
- Structure: create a new `### Session N` heading (increment N) followed by the table below.
- Ordering: keep sessions in chronological order (new sessions appended at the end).
- Commit: commit after each session so GitHub stays in sync.

Template table to copy:

| Section | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Session Overview | • Date: YYYY-MM-DD<br>• Topic: [Topic] |
| Reading Summary | • Chapters/Sections Covered: [Source — sections]<br>• Key Insights:<br>• [Takeaway 1]<br>• [Takeaway 2] |
| Hands-On Experiment | • Experiment Description: [Short description]<br>• Observations:<br>• [Observation]<br>• [Surprising result] |
| Video & Reflection | • Video Title/Link: [Title] [URL]<br>• Reflections:<br>• [Reflection 1]<br>• [Reflection 2] |
| Wrap-Up Note | • Session Summary: [2–3 sentences]<br>• Next Steps:<br>• [1–3 bullets] |

Quick commit steps:
- `git add README.md`
- `git commit -m "docs: add Session N summary to README"`
- `git pull --rebase && git push`
